# Email_Spam
This project is a spam detection system that uses a Naive Bayes classifier to identify whether a message is spam or not. It takes a dataset of messages labeled as spam or ham, converts the text into numerical features using a Bag of Words model, and trains a Naive Bayes model on this data. The model achieves an accuracy of 98.7% and can classify new messages as either spam or ham.
